What is this thing?

ðŸ’° It's free.
ðŸ™Œ It's a tool that puts in billing & shipping details into Adidas.com in order to buy shoes, such as Yeezys.
* It's an extension to Google Chrome. You need to download Chrome to use this tool.
How do I get this thing to work?

This should take 5 minutes to setup by yourself. It might be a little complicated to get setup, but follow the steps below and you'll be set. You don't need to know how to code or anything; You just need to know how to type in Credit Card details and shipping info. If you can't figure it out, send me an email with the issue and i'll fix it for you.

Part 1: Getting Started

Just a few steps to get it setup:


Click the Download button on this page that gets you a ZIP file. Please download the ZIP to somewhere on your desktop, or somewhere easy to find.

Unpack the ZIP, by clicking on it.

You're going to see a folder full of files with code that makes the tool work.

Click only on the file that's called YeezyCopper.JS.

Now the file should be open in an editor or something like this: yeezycopper.js file editor view

Edit the information to reflect your shipping & CC details. It should be easy-- I put hints to the right of each field.

SAVE the file once you typed everything in. Also, make sure that you didn't have any typos.

Part 2: Finishing it Up

You're almost done. Now we have to put the tool into Chrome and run it on Adidas.com:


Go to chrome://extensions/.

Click the Developer Mode checkbox.

Click "Load Unpacked Extension" and then just select the folder with all the files you downloaded.

Click Install.

You have it setup. Good job!!




Part 3: Try it out!

You need to be already logged into Adidas.com

Use the extension on any page that you want to buy shoes from. This extension is designed for Yeezys, but it works the same on any other pair of shoes you want from Adidas.

Sometimes you're going to need to fill out something called a CAPTCHA, so after that happens, press the G key on your keyboard. Then, the software will fill out the forms with all the info you typed in earlier and cop your shoes.

Good luck!

Notes/Troubleshooting:

Did something break? Check below for some help:




If the extension is disabled or is messing up for whatever reason, delete it in chrome://extensions and redo Step 2.
Make sure you have NO typos. It won't work if you have a typo.
Make sure you are logged into Adidas.com before using this.
I'm not responsible for you not knowing how to get this thing working for your misuse of this software. I'll try my best to help, email me.
Don't keep this running after you get your shoes. Delete this garbage from Chrome as soon as you cop.
Sorry this thing is so hard to get setup. Google denied my request to make this a one-click install because they picked up it's kind-of bad for Adidas to have this floating around in the open.

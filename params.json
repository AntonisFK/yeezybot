You need to download [Chrome (https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html)to use this tool.\r\n\r\n# How do I get this thing to work?\r\nThis should take 5 minutes to setup by yourself. It might be a little complicated to get setup, but follow the steps below and you'll be set. You don't need to know how to code or anything; You just need to know how to type in Credit Card details and shipping info. If you can't figure it out, [send me an email with the issue](mailto:anton@klingspor.com) and i'll fix it for you.\r\n\r\n## Part 1: Getting Started\r\nJust a few steps to get it setup:\r\n1. Click the Download button on this page that gets you a ZIP file. Please download the ZIP to somewhere on your desktop,                   or somewhere on your computer that you'll easily find.\r\n\r\n1. Unpack the ZIP, by clicking on it. \r\n\r\n1. You're going to see a folder full of files with code that makes the tool work. \r\n\r\n4. Click only on the file that's called **YeezyCopper.JS**.\r\n\r\n5. Now the file should be open in an editor or something like this:\r\n![yeezycopper.js file editor view](http://i.imgur.com/omf7O0h.png)\r\n\r\n6. Edit the information to reflect your shipping & CC details. It should be easy-- I put hints to the right of each field.\r\n\r\n7. **SAVE** the file once you typed everything in. Also, make sure that you didn't have any typos.\r\n\r\n## Part 2: Finishing it Up\r\nYou're almost done. Now we have to put the tool into Chrome and run it on Adidas.com:\r\n1. Go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/).\r\n\r\n2. Click the Developer Mode checkbox.\r\n\r\n3. Click \"Pack Extension\".\r\n\r\n4. For extension root directory, just browse or select where you have the folder with all the files that you downloaded earlier, and where you put in the information for your Shipping/Billing/etc.\r\n\r\n5. Don't worry about the Private file key. That doesn't matter.\r\n\r\n6. Click \"Pack Extension\".\r\n\r\n7. It'll take a second or two. Then find the .crx file it created and drag it into the window and click Install.\r\n\r\n8. You have it setup. Good job!!\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aklingspor/yeezy-copper/master/gif1.gif\" />\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n## Part 3: DONE\r\n1. You need to be already logged into Adidas.com\r\n\r\n2. Use the extension on any page that you want to buy shoes from. This extension is designed for Yeezys, but it works the same on any other pair of shoes you want from Adidas.\r\n\r\n3. Good luck!\r\n\r\n## Notes/Troubleshooting:\r\nDid something break? Check below for some help:\r\n<p>\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aklingspor/yeezy-copper/master/gif2.gif\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n* Make sure you have NO typos. It won't work if you have a typo.\r\n* Make sure you are logged into Adidas.com before using this.\r\n* I'm not responsible for you not knowing how to get this thing working for your misuse of this software. I'll try my best to help, [email me](mailto:anton@klingspor.com).\r\n* Don't keep this running after you get your shoes. Delete this garbage from Chrome as soon as you cop.\r\n* Sorry this thing is so hard to get setup. Google denied my request to make this a one-click install because they picked up it's kind-of bad for Adidas to have this floating around in the open.\r\n\r\n",

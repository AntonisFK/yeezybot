I am not liable for anything you cop using this and I wouldnt use it unless you understand what its doing.\r\n* Don't keep this running (Especially since it will auto cop on page load). Delete this garbage as soon as you cop.\r\n* jQuery spaghetti chrome extensions are so fun to make. see also [twitter-classic](https://github.com/artnotfound/twitter-classic)\r\n* T.L.O.P. the greatest album of life\r\n",
